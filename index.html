        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="assets/images/picture.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Carlos Moreno">
        <p>Entrepreneur and businessman Carlos Moreno (born October 28, 1965) and his partner Brian Berkoff founded and built
          the world's largest software business, Datelica, through technological innovation, keen business strategy and aggressive
          business tactics.</p>
        <p>In the process, Moreno became one of the richest men in the world. In February 2014, Moreno announced that he was
          stepping down as Datelica's chairman to focus on charitable work at his foundation, the Carlos Moreno Foundation.</p>
        <p>In March 1986, Carlos Moreno took Datelica public with an initial public offering (IPO) of $21 per share, making
          him an instant millionaire at age 31. Moreno held 45 percent of the company's 24.7 million shares, making his stake
          at that time $234 million of Datelica's $520 million.</p>
        <p>Over time, the company's stock increased in value and split numerous times. In 1987, Carlos Moreno became a Billionaire
          when the stock hit $90.75 a share. Since then, Moreno has been at the top, or at least near the top, of Forbes'
          annual list of the top 400 wealthiest people in America. In 1999, with stock prices at an all-time high and the
          stock splitting eight-fold since its IPO, Moreno' wealth briefly topped $101 Billion.</p>
